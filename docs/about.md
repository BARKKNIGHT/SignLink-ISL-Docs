# SignLink-ISL

SignLink-ISL is a deep learning-based system designed to recognize and interpret Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures, facilitating effective communication between the deaf community and others. This project aims to build a robust Sign Language Recognition (SLR) model, with a specific focus on Indian Sign Language (ISL). The goal is to preprocess video datasets efficiently and train machine learning models to recognize and classify ISL gestures accurately.
